## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r }
uniformDis <- runif(999)
hist(uniformDis)
```

```{r}
 normalDis <- rnorm(999)

hist(normalDis)
```

```{r}
x <- rbinom(999,150,.4)
hist(x)
```
The Central Limit Theorem says that as n increases, the binomial distribution with n trials and probability p of success gets closer and closer to a normal distribution. That is, the binomial probability of any event gets closer and closer to the normal probability of the same event.
