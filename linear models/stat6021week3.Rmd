## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
insurance <- read.csv("insurance.csv")
head(insurance)
```
```{r}
mod1 <- lm(charges~smoker, data = insurance)
summary(mod1)
```

```{r}
t.test(charges~smoker, data = insurance)
```
```{r}
new <-  data.frame(smoker='yes')
predict(mod1, new)
```
```{r}
mod2 <- lm(charges~region, data = insurance)
summary(mod2)
```
average insurance cost region northwest is the intercept, each estimate shows the difference between northwest and that region.
