Question [1]
```{r}
OurData <- read.csv('ClassData.csv')
head(OurData)
```
Question [2]
```{r}
ourData2 <- OurData %>%
  mutate(slp=as.numeric(Sleep_Hrs)) %>%
  mutate(Phone_Hrs=as.numeric(Phone_Time))
```
Question [3]
```{r}
ggplot(ourData2,aes(x=Phone_Hrs,y=slp)) + geom_jitter()
```
There does not appear to be any sort of linear relationship between phone hours and sleep.
Question [4]

```{r}
t.test(ourData2$Phone_Hrs)
```
mean phone usage hours is between the intervals of 3.700369 - 4.531694 with 95%
confidence.
